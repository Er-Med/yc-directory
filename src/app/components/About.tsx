            From a <strong>young age</strong>, I&apos;ve always been fascinated
            by how things work, especially when it comes to technology. But it
            wasn&apos;t until 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, that I truly
            acted on my <strong>curiosity</strong>. At that time, I found myself
            searching online for{" "}
            <strong>
              How do websites work <InfoIcon name='Question' />
            </strong>{" "}
            and that&apos;s when I discovered <strong>coding</strong>. Learning
            that websites were built by people using code felt like unlocking a
            hidden superpower, and from that moment, I knew I wanted to dive
            deeper.

            Now, at <strong>23 years</strong> old, I specialize in{" "}
            <strong>front-end development</strong>, focusing on

            <TechIcon name='Tailwindcss' />, and <TechIcon name='SCSS' />.
            Although I&apos;ve chosen to focus on these technologies, my solid

            websites that deliver an exceptional experience. While my diploma in

            and refine my craft is something I deeply value. I look forward to
            transforming ideas into interactive experiences with the support of
            experienced professionals who can guide me in my journey.
